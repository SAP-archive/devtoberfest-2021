### Demystifying Data Science in the Enterprise
November 2nd, [10:00 CET / 14:30 IST / 17:00 SGT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211102T090000&p1=136&p2=83&p3=367&p4=438&p5=236&p6=248&p7=240)

Data Science has been a hot topic in the enterprise in the last decade. Thanks to advances in deep learning, the role of data scientists has expanded into new applications, namely building AI services.

In this talk we describe machine learning use-cases from our team and describe our learnings and takeaways.

### The Modern Enterprise Data Landscape
November 2nd, [17:00 CET / 09:00 MST / 21:30 IST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211102T160000&p1=83&p2=45&p3=179&p4=64&p5=155&p6=224&p7=197&p8=438)

Enterprise-scale data management has long been a highly complex and often frustrating proposition. Today, with data warehouses and data marts, data lakes, data lakehouses, data fabric, data mesh, multimodel data platforms and more… your alternatives can be mind-numbing and make you feel as if you’ll never reach your enterprise data management goals.

40-year technology veteran Alan Simon untangles and demystifies the enterprise data management landscape, helping you leap beyond jargon and the latest hot trends through a grounded-in-reality approach to address your longstanding challenges. Whether you are a newcomer to enterprise data or a longtime practitioner, this presentation will help expand your personal data management solutions portfolio and navigate the ever-changing enterprise data landscape.

### Data Visualization: Then and Now
November 4th, [10:00 CET / 14:30 IST / 17:00 SGT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211104T090000&p1=136&p2=83&p3=367&p4=438&p5=236&p6=248&p7=240)

Data Visualization is the new old topic. Surprisingly its history is not that long even if spreadsheets made data exploration ubiquitous. But as Data is moving into 3xV directions (Volume, Velocity and Variety) so is modern Visualization of it. After going through a bit of a theory we will move into practical aspects of Data Storytelling and Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Fun Friday Activity

### Let's talk **Coding for Kids**!

Did you know that SAP makes its own visual programming language for Computing Education? Let us tell (and show) you all about it: [Snap! Build Your Own Blocks](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) is the programming language kids in Silicon Valley learn in high school and college students at UC Berkeley use to explore the Beauty and Joy of Computing. We'll take you on an exclusive backstage tour of our R&D lab.

### Snap! Designing a Programming Language for All Children

November 5th, [10:00 CET / 14:30 IST / 17:00 SGT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211105T090000&p1=136&p2=83&p3=367&p4=438&p5=236&p6=248&p7=240)

Snap! is an interactive, massively parallel visual programming language implemented inside its own multi-threaded graphical user interface framework. It is a free and open-source software project deployed in web browsers and is used in educational institutions and  "out in the wild" around the globe.

We develop Snap! at SAP in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley. Join us for a virtual tour of our "Lab" and learn about our design principles, architecture and pedagogical mission.

📺 [Join us live on YouTube](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/devtoberfest-week-5-fun-friday.html#363116a7-849e-4701-bb6a-79b5068875d7), and get involved!

### Snap! Programming Beauty and Joy

November 5th, [16:00 CET / 08:00 PST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211105T150000&p1=83&p2=45&p3=179&p4=64&p5=155&p6=224)

Snap! is the programming language that has been developed for UC Berkeley's "Beauty and Joy of Computing" course. It highlights powerful ideas in computing by encouraging learners to create visually appealing and mathematically elegant artifacts.

In this session we'll show you all about Snap! and invite you to explore classical algorithmic art through recoding and remixing.
