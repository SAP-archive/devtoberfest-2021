Every company that claims to be a cloud company, claims to be developing Microservices. Yet it is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the software industry, and the misunderstandings already start with the name. If those misunderstandings can be sorted out, organizations see tremendous benefits to their structure and processes. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a catch - there ain‚Äôt no such thing as a free lunch. In this talk we will explore the details.

### Christian Lechner "Pour Some Serverless On Me"

Date and Time: Thursday, October 21st at 17:00 CEST  20:30 IST. 11:00 EDT [üåé](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211021T150000&p1=37&p2=198&p3=438&p4=240&p5=tz_sgt)

There are a lot of choices that you can make when developing cloud native solutions. But choices are hard, so it is fair to ask: "What is the approach that embraces cloud native paradigms the most as of today?" My hypothesis: _serverless_ is the closest you can get. Let us explore why serverless perfectly supports you in your journey heading for cloud-native solutions. You will experience how low the entry barrier is to develop your first function using Azure Functions, couple it to a persistency and even develop a stateful serverless workflow (what ...ü§Ø).

### Eric Johnson "Attitude of Iteration"
Date and Time: Friday, October 22nd at 17:00 CEST / 20:30 IST (Bengaluru) / 11:00 EDT / 09:00 MDT (Denver) [üåé](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211022T150000&p1=37&p2=198&p3=438&p4=240&p5=tz_sgt)

Challenges are a very real part of daily life. Some challenges are very apparent, like having one finger on each hand. Other challenges, are less apparent but no
less of a hurdle that must be jumped. As someone who was born different and has been challenged through life, I have a very interesting view on hitting challenges
head on. I also like to laugh as I deal with these challenges. In this session we will joke our way through having an attitude of iteration in how we deal with
challenges in our personal lives AND in our work lives. Prepare to laugh, commiserate, and face your challenges!
