## Redux
The basic Redux example is on branch `redux-example`.
The example using Redux Toolkit is on branch `redux-toolkit-example`.

[Here is the link to the Getting Started page in the Redux Documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started). Note that the official documentation is now based on Redux Toolkit, instead of basic Redux. There are still a lot of articles on adding basic Redux to new projects but the way forward is likely going to be using Redux Toolkit. Knowing both is good as a lot of projects still use basic Redux as the toolkit is very new.
