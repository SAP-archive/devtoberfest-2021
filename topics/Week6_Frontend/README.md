# Frontend

This topic content is for Devtoberfest Week 6 : 8 November ‚Üí 12 November 2021.

The frontend is the only project component that your business users will ever interact with directly. Consequentially, its implementation will shape the first impression of your project - So make it count!

In this topic week, we look at some general trends topics that impact your web-based frontend. Each session will focus on upcoming industry trends and relate SAP's frameworks and services to its developer ecosystem. As this topic area to so incredibly wide, we'll concentrate on web-based frontends. This also avoids certain limitations on the development requirements that would come with native application development.

For this week's tutorial and code challenge content, we preselected a set of tutorials that cover four different web frameworks. This should empower developers to pick the framework they feel most comfortable in (Bonus points if you do several of them).

### Micro Frontends with Luigi ‚Äì UI Development at Scale
November 9th, 9:00 CET (Berlin) / 13:30 IST (Bengaluru) / 19:00 AEDT (Melbourne) [üåèüåçüåé](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211109T080000&p1=152&p2=438&p3=83&p4=45&p5=179&p6=64&p7=155&p8=197&p9=224)

Duration: 30 minutes

This session will give insights about a trending topic in frontend development - Micro Frontends. This architecture style addresses the challenge of having a frontend that is too big to manage and coordinate across multiple teams or products. You will learn about its key aspects, technical and organizational issues it induces, and how these can be handled, on the example of project "Luigi", SAP's own open-source Micro Frontend framework.

Duration: 30 minutes

If you are looking for a way of implementing reusable components with Vanilla JavaScript and no framework-specific dependencies, then this session might be just for you. In this talk, we will take a deep dive into the Web Components standards:
- Custom Elements
- Shadow DOM
- HTML Templates
- ES Modules

We will put our new knowledge into practice by implementing our first Web Component. Moreover, we will take a glance at the usage of Web Components within the SAP ecosystem.

State management for the frontend. No more sinking props down layers of components and bubbling results back up. Access all your common data in one place with Redux! In this presentation, I will walk through what Redux is, why you would use it, how you would use it, and how you could simplify it with Redux Toolkit.

## Coding Challenge

Go here to find the [Devtoberfest 2021 Frontend Week Coding Challenge](https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021-frontend-coding-challenge). The repo contains a web application that displays all current services available on the SAP Business Technology Platform. 

![Running app in light mode](./running.png)

Unfortunately, this app doesn't have the best loading performance. The [Lighthouse performance score](https://web.dev/performance-scoring/) is way below the achievable 100 points. Luckily, this is not the fault of the framework used but happened due to a bad implementation and disregard of [common best practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBF_8eOjuc8). It‚Äôs up to you to fix this web application and to push the performance score above 70.

To participate, you need to fork and clone the repository first. Once you made the improvements, open a pull request that will be reviewed automatically. If your app passes, your pull request gets a "passed" label, and you can enter your SAP Community ID to earn your badge. For more detailed instructions, please look at the "Contributing" section of the [coding challenge repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021-frontend-coding-challenge#contributing--submitting-your-proposal).
