# Frontend

This topic content is for Devtoberfest Week 6 : 8 November → 12 November 2021.

The frontend is the only project component that your business users will ever interact with directly. Consequentially, its implementation will shape the first impression of your project - So make it count!

In this topic week, we look at some general trends topics that impact your web-based frontend. Each session will focus on upcoming industry trends and relate SAP's frameworks and services to its developer ecosystem. As this topic area to so incredibly wide, we'll concentrate on web-based frontends. This also avoids certain limitations on the development requirements that would come with native application development.

For this week's tutorial and code challenge content, we preselected a set of tutorials that cover four different web frameworks. This should empower developers to pick the framework they feel most comfortable in (Bonus points if you do several of them).

## Presentations

### Micro Frontends with Luigi – UI Development at Scale
Schedule - TBD

This session will give insights about a trending topic in frontend development - Micro Frontends. This architecture style addresses the challenge of having a frontend that is too big to manage and coordinate across multiple teams or products. You will learn about its key aspects, technical and organizational issues it induces, and how these can be handled, on the example of project "Luigi", SAP's own open-source Micro Frontend framework.

Schedule - TBD

State management for the frontend. No more sinking props down layers of components and bubbling results back up. Access all your common data in one place with Redux! In this presentation, I will walk through what Redux is, why you would use it, how you would use it, and how you could simplify it with Redux Toolkit.

### Web Components: The reusable building blocks of web 
Schedule - TBD

If you are looking for a way of implementing reusable components with Vanilla JavaScript and no framework-specific dependencies, then this session might be just for you. In this talk, we will take a deep dive into the Web Components standards:
- Custom Elements
- Shadow DOM
- HTML Templates
- ES Modules

We will put our new knowledge into practice by implementing our first Web Component. Moreover, we will take a glance at the usage of Web Components within the SAP ecosystem.
