# Security

This topic content is for Devtoberfest Week 4 : 25 October â†’ 29 October 2021.

Security, as a topic, has an interesting place for most developers.  While it's universally agreed to be an important topic; too often in the development process it becomes an afterthough or something left to "the security team". 

In this topic week we want to look at some general security topics that impacts all types of developers. We will look at how to protect your applications from hackers, how to deal with the Cloud Native security implications and how to write more secure code. 

For the tutorial and code challenge content of this week there will be a speacial focus on security within ABAP and the Node.js/JavaScript areas.

## Presentations 

### CÃ©dric Hebert "Hackers Want Passwords"
Date and Time: Monday, October 25th at 17:00 CEST / 23:00 SGT / 11:00 EDT [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211025T150000&p1=37&p2=198&p3=438&p4=240&p5=tz_sgt)

Duration: 50 mins

75% of cloud intrusions are done through the usage of valid credentials. Can we do anything besides more stringent password rules? What aboutâ€¦ poisoning the well?
  
In this presentation we will show you via three demos how cloud applications could actively fight against leaked credentials, password spreading and even phishing, by adopting honey passwords.

You donâ€™t think this can work? Iâ€™d love to hear your reservations. Loving it? Then spread the word and help make the Internet a more secure place!

As a certified expert of the Security Research team, he spends his time influencing SAP's security practices and products with innovating yet practical solutions. After kickstarting SAP's Threat Modeling approach and giving birth to the SAP Enterprise Threat Detection product, he thinks itâ€™s time to tap into the potential of cyber-deception - and he will keep using his and his team's energy to make this happen.

### Thomas Jung "Security Aspects of SAP Cloud Application Programming Model"
Date and Time: Wednesday, October 27th at 17:00 CEST / 23:00 SGT / 11:00 EDT [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211027T150000&p1=37&p2=198&p3=438&p4=240&p5=tz_sgt)

Duration: 50 mins

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model comes out of the box with lots of best practice security baked into the framework.  However there are also things that each developer need to take responsibility for when building applications with CAP. In this session we will look at techniques like adding XSUAA and roles, configuring Helmet for content security policies, and how to deal with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

### Michele Chubirka "Container Security: It's All About the Supply Chain"
Date and Time: Thursday, October 28th at 17:00 CEST / 23:00 SGT / 11:00 EDT [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211028T150000&p1=37&p2=198&p3=438&p4=240&p5=tz_sgt)

Duration: 50 mins

Containers continue to mystify security practitioners, mostly because they donâ€™t know how securing them fits into their existing programs. Is it a virtual machine that gets scanned by the same tools used for over a decade? Or is it an application package that should be tested by SCA, SAST and DAST tools? How do you manage the image or runtime vulnerabilities vs the application security issues? This talk will focus on container security as a supply chain lifecycle problem and how to integrate validation at multiple points to achieve the ultimate goal of *assurance.* The talk is tool agnostic, because security of the supply chain is more about the alignment with the software development process than the integration of a single magical tool.
