## Dogtoberfest Day

On October 15th, our furry friends take over Devtoberfest. We encourage you to post pictures of your dogs(or other pet) with you in a work, coding or general office setting.  Post those with the hashtag #dogtoberfest where ever you like so the community can easily find all the content. Then complete this simple [validation tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/devtoberfest-dogtoberfest.html) to get a cool Dogtoberfest badge for your SAP Community Profile. We look forward to seeing and sharing our own pet pics.
