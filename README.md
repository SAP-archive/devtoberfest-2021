## Contest (The Game)

A game that is open to all developers.  Points can be accrued by completing items listed on [the game page readme](contest/readme.md).  Points are awarded for things such as attending a presentation or completing tutorials on SAP Community. Prizes are awarded based on badges earned and associated points accumulated.  Prize and Points are described on [the game page readme](contest/readme.md) as well as the rules relating to how many winners will make it to the Grand Prize Winner drawing.

For full details on the contest aspects please see the [Game Page Readme](contest/readme.md) and of course for all the rules see [Terms and Conditions](TOC.md).

But the fun doesnâ€™t end there.  We have an animated Contest Gameboard to help you track your progress through the contest.  Just replace `scnId.Here` with your SAP Community Profile ID to the end of the following URL: [https://devrel-tools-prod-scn-badges-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/devtoberfestContest/scnId.Here](https://devrel-tools-prod-scn-badges-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/devtoberfestContest/scnId.Here).

And if you are curious how we built the animated gameboard, we have also released the whole thing as a Sample Code repository here: [https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-community-activity-badges](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-community-activity-badges)

## All Work and No Play? Nope!

As part of the entire Devetoberfest celebration we want to take time to have some fun and relax with topics outside the normal work day. Therefore we will have special sessions each Friday during Devetobefest specifically for fun in mind. Check the topic agenda pages of each week for more details.
