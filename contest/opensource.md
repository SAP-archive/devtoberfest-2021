# Open Source Contributions

Although this year's Devtoberfest contest has many new activities, we still want to recognize and award contest points for active and new SAP community focused open source projects.  

Therefore to submit your open source project for consideration as part of Devtoberfest 2021, we ask that you add the URL to your project and SAP Community ID in the [entry.csv](entry.csv) via pull request.

A list of all submitted open source projects with details can be found in [entries.md](entries.md)
